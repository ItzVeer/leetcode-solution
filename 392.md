# 392. Is Subsequence

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `s` is a subsequence of `t`, or `false` otherwise.

## Definition

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. 

For example:
- `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"` while `"aec"` is not.

## Examples

### Example 1
- **Input:** `s = "abc"`, `t = "ahbgdc"`
- **Output:** `true`

### Example 2
- **Input:** `s = "axc"`, `t = "ahbgdc"`
- **Output:** `false`

## Constraints
- (0 <= s.length <= 100)
- (0 <= t.length <= 10^4)
- `s` and `t` consist only of lowercase English letters.

## Follow-up
Suppose there are lots of incoming strings \(s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_k\) where \(k \geq 10^9\), and you want to check one by one to see if `t` has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

## Solution

Here is a Python implementation to determine if `s` is a subsequence of `t`:

```python
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        A = len(s)
        B = len(t)

        if A > B: 
            return False
        if s == "":
            return True

        a = 0
        for b in range(B):
            if t[b] == s[a]:
                if a == A - 1:
                    return True
                a += 1

        return False
