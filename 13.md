# 13. Roman to Integer

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D, and M.

| Symbol | Value |
|--------|-------|
| I      | 1     |
| V      | 5     |
| X      | 10    |
| L      | 50    |
| C      | 100   |
| D      | 500   |
| M      | 1000  |

## Description

For example:
- 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together.
- 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II.
- The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, there are exceptions:
- The numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four.
- The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX.

There are six instances where subtraction is used:
- I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.
- X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.
- C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given a Roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

## Solution

Here is a Python implementation of the solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def romanToInt(self, s: str) -> int:
        romanValue = {"I":1,"V":5,"X":10,"L":50,"C":100,"D":500,"M":1000}
        total = 0
        i = 0
        n = len(s)
        
        while i < n:
            if i < n-1 and romanValue[s[i]] < romanValue[s[i+1]]:
                total += romanValue[s[i+1]] - romanValue[s[i]]
                i += 2
            else:
                total += romanValue[s[i]]
                i += 1

        return total
