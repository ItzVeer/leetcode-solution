# 11. Container With Most Water

You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `i`th line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

**Notice:** You may not slant the container.

## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:** 
```python
height = [1, 8, 6, 2, 5, 4, 8, 3, 7]
```
**Output:** 
```python
49
```
**Explanation:** 
The above vertical lines are represented by array `[1, 8, 6, 2, 5, 4, 8, 3, 7]`. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is `49`.

### Example 2:

**Input:** 
```python
height = [1, 1]
```
**Output:** 
```python
1
```

## Constraints

- `( n == text{height.length} )`
- `( 2 <= n <= 10^5 )`
- `( 0 <= text{height[i]} <= 10^4 )`

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        left = 0
        right = len(height) - 1
        max_area = 0

        while left < right:
            w = right - left
            h = min(height[right], height[left])
            a = w * h
            max_area = max(a, max_area)

            if height[left] < height[right]:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1
        
        return max_area
```

### Time Complexity
