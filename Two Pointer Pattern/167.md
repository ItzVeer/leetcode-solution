# 167. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted

Given a 1-indexed array of integers `numbers` that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, the goal is to find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be `numbers[index1]` and `numbers[index2]` where (`1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length`).

Return the indices of the two numbers, `index1` and `index2`, added by one as an integer array `[index1, index2]` of length 2.

The problem guarantees that there is exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. Your solution must use only constant extra space.

## Examples

### Example 1
- **Input:** `numbers = [2, 7, 11, 15]`, `target = 9`
- **Output:** `[1, 2]`
- **Explanation:** The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, `index1 = 1`, `index2 = 2`. We return `[1, 2]`.

### Example 2
- **Input:** `numbers = [2, 3, 4]`, `target = 6`
- **Output:** `[1, 3]`
- **Explanation:** The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore, `index1 = 1`, `index2 = 3`. We return `[1, 3]`.

### Example 3
- **Input:** `numbers = [-1, 0]`, `target = -1`
- **Output:** `[1, 2]`
- **Explanation:** The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore, `index1 = 1`, `index2 = 2`. We return `[1, 2]`.

## Constraints
- (`2 <= text{numbers.length} <= 3 times 10^4`)
- (`-1000 <= text{numbers[i]} <= 1000`)
- The array `numbers` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- (`-1000 <= target <= 1000`)
- The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution.

## Solution

The solution employs a two-pointer technique to efficiently find the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target. This approach runs in linear time and uses only constant extra space.

### Python Code

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        leftIndex = 0
        rightIndex = len(numbers) - 1
        
        while leftIndex < rightIndex:
            current_sum = numbers[leftIndex] + numbers[rightIndex]
            
            if current_sum == target:
                return [leftIndex + 1, rightIndex + 1]
            elif current_sum > target:
                rightIndex -= 1
            else:
                leftIndex += 1
