# 1768. Merge Strings Alternately

You are given two strings `word1` and `word2`. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with `word1`. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string. Return the merged string.

## Solution

Here is a Python implementation of the solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def mergeAlternately(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> str:
        A, B = len(word1), len(word2)
        a, b = 0, 0
        output = []
        word = 1
        
        while a < A and b < B:
            if word == 1:
                output.append(word1[a])
                a += 1
                word = 2
            else:
                output.append(word2[b])
                b += 1
                word = 1

        while a < A:
            output.append(word1[a])
            a += 1

        while b < B:
            output.append(word2[b])
            b += 1

        return "".join(output)
