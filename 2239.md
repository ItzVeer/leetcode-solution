# 2239. Find Closest Number to Zero

Given an integer array `nums` of size `n`, return the number with the value closest to 0 in `nums`. If there are multiple answers, return the number with the largest value.

## Solution

Here is a Python implementation of the solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def findClosestNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nearest = nums

        for num in nums:
            if abs(num) < abs(nearest):
                nearest = num
        
        if nearest < 0 and abs(nearest) in nums:
            return abs(nearest)
        else:
            return nearest
